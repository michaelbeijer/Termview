This page helps you estimate the API cost of using AI features in Supervertaler for Trados. All prices are based on official provider pricing as of March 2026 and are shown in **US dollars**.

{% hint style="info" %}
AI provider costs are **separate** from your Supervertaler licence. You pay the AI provider directly for the tokens your requests consume. Supervertaler does not add any markup.
{% endhint %}

### How costs are calculated

AI providers charge per **token** – a unit of text roughly equal to ¾ of a word. Costs depend on:

* **Input tokens** – the text you send (source segment, system prompt, terminology context)
* **Output tokens** – the text the model returns (translated segment, proofread text, generated prompt)

Because Supervertaler translates **segment by segment**, the system prompt and terminology context are included with every segment. For a typical 5,000-word document (\~250 segments), this means:

| Task                | Input tokens | Output tokens |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| **Batch Translate** | \~125,000    | \~8,000       |
| **AI Proofreader**  | \~140,000    | \~8,000       |
| **AutoPrompt**      | \~10,000     | \~2,000       |

These are estimates for a representative document. Actual usage varies with segment length, terminology context size, and prompt complexity.

#### OpenRouter

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) lets you access models from all major providers with a single API key. Prices are the same as the provider's own rates plus a **5.5% platform fee**. The curated models in the Supervertaler dropdown include:

| Model                                | Translate | Proofread | AutoPrompt |

{% endhint %}

#### Ollama (local)

| Model                  | Translate | Proofread | AutoPrompt |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **TranslateGemma 12B** | Free      | Free      | Free       |
| **TranslateGemma 4B**  | Free      | Free      | Free       |
| **Qwen 3 14B**         | Free      | Free      | Free       |
| **Aya Expanse 8B**     | Free      | Free      | Free       |

{% hint style="success" %}
**Ollama models run on your own computer** – there are no API costs. The trade-off is that quality depends on your hardware and the models are generally less capable than cloud-hosted models. See [AI Settings](settings/ai-settings.md) for setup instructions.
{% endhint %}

### Our recommendation

{% hint style="success" %}
**If you could only pick one model for everything – translation, proofreading, and chat – we would recommend Claude Sonnet 4.6.** It follows translation instructions precisely, handles terminology constraints well, is fast enough for batch operations, and delivers consistently high quality across legal, technical, and general content. It costs roughly $0.50 per 5,000-word document, which is a fraction of a cent per segment.
{% endhint %}

For budget-conscious batch work, **GPT-5.4 Mini** or **Gemini 2.5 Flash** offer excellent quality at a fraction of the price. For the absolute highest quality on specialised content, **Claude Opus 4.6** or **GPT-5.4** are worth the premium.

| Grok 4.20 (Reasoning)    | $2.00                 | $6.00                  |
| Mistral Large            | $2.00                 | $6.00                  |

### Tips for managing costs

* **Start with a budget model** – GPT-5.4 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, or Grok 4.1 Fast are excellent for routine translation at a fraction of the cost.
* **Use premium models selectively** – reserve GPT-5.4, Claude Opus, or Gemini 2.5 Pro for specialised content (legal, medical, patents) where the quality difference justifies the cost.
* **Try Ollama for zero cost** – if you have a computer with 8+ GB of RAM, TranslateGemma 12B delivers surprisingly good results for free.
* **Check your usage** – the [Usage Statistics](settings/usage-statistics.md) tab in Settings tracks your token consumption per provider.

### Built-in cost protection

Supervertaler includes several safeguards to help you avoid unexpected costs:

#### QuickLauncher prompts are standalone

When you run a prompt from the QuickLauncher menu (Ctrl+Q), only the prompt itself is sent to the AI – **not the chat history**. This means a simple terminology query costs only what it needs to, even if you have a long conversation in the chat window.

#### Chat token budget

Regular chat messages include recent conversation history so the AI can follow your discussion. However, Supervertaler automatically trims older messages when the history grows too large (\~50,000 tokens). This prevents costs from spiralling when previous messages contained large context blocks (e.g. full document content).

#### Cost warning

If a request is estimated to cost more than $0.50 in input tokens, a confirmation dialogueue appears showing the estimated token count and cost. You can cancel before the expensive request is sent.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Keep an eye on the cost indicators.** Every AI response in the chat shows the estimated token count and cost. You can also review all prompts and their costs in the **Reports** tab.
{% endhint %}

#### Choosing the right model

For everyday work – chat queries, terminology questions, QuickLauncher prompts – use **GPT-5.4 Mini** or another budget model. Reserve premium models like **GPT-5.4** or **Claude Opus** for AutoPrompt and complex tasks where the quality difference justifies the cost.
