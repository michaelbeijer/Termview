# Usage Statistics

Supervertaler for Trados includes an optional, anonymous usage statistics feature to help the developer understand how many people are using the plugin and what environments they are running it on.

### How it works

* **Strictly opt-in** — on first launch after install or update, a dialog asks if you would like to participate. You must explicitly click "Yes" to opt in. If you click "No", no data is ever sent.
* **Minimal data** — a single lightweight ping is sent once per session on plugin startup. The only data included is:
  * A random anonymous ID (a UUID generated locally on your machine — not tied to any account, machine, or identity)
  * Plugin version (e.g. 4.11.0)
  * OS version (e.g. Windows 11)
  * Trados Studio version
  * System locale (e.g. en-GB)
* **Country detection** — the hosting provider (Cloudflare) determines your country from the network connection. No IP addresses are stored.
* **Silent failure** — if the ping fails (no internet, firewall, etc.), nothing happens. No retries, no queuing, no error messages.
* **First-party only** — data is sent to a Supervertaler-operated Cloudflare Worker endpoint. No third-party trackers, no Google Analytics, no advertising platforms.

### What is NOT collected

* No translation content
* No termbase or glossary data
* No file names or project names
* No personal information (name, email, etc.)
* No information about which features you use or how often
* No API keys or credentials

### Changing your preference

You can change your choice at any time:

1. Open **Settings** (click the gear icon in the Supervertaler panel)
2. In the **TermLens** tab, scroll to the bottom
3. Check or uncheck **"Share anonymous usage statistics (no personal data)"**
4. Click **OK**

The change takes effect on the next Trados Studio session.

### Why this exists

As a solo developer, usage statistics provide invaluable insight into:

* How many people are actually using the plugin
* Which Trados Studio versions to prioritise for testing and compatibility
* Which OS versions and locales are most common
* Whether users run Trados on a Mac (via Parallels) or natively on Windows

This information directly informs development priorities and compatibility testing.

### Transparency

The full source code for both the plugin-side statistics and the server-side endpoint is publicly available:

* **Plugin code**: [`Core/UsageStatistics.cs`](../../src/Supervertaler.Trados/Core/UsageStatistics.cs) on GitHub
* **Server code**: The Cloudflare Worker that receives the pings is also open source

You can verify exactly what data is sent by inspecting the code yourself.
