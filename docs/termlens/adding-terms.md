Supervertaler for Trados provides several ways to add, edit, and manage terminology without leaving the Trados editor.

## Quick-add (Alt+Down)

The fastest way to add a term while translating:

1. Select the **source text** you want to add as a term
2. Select the **target text** (the translation)
3. Press **Alt+Down**

The term is added instantly to all **write-enabled** termbases. No dialog, no interruption.

{% hint style="info" %}
Quick-add writes to every termbase that has **Write** enabled in your [TermLens Settings](../settings/termlens.md). If you want to target a specific termbase, use the Add Term Entry dialog (Ctrl+Alt+T) instead.
{% endhint %}

## Quick-add to project termbase (Alt+Up)

Works the same as Alt+Down, but adds the term specifically to the **project termbase** (the termbase marked as "Project" in settings). Use this when you want to keep client-specific terminology separate and prioritised.

1. Select the **source text**
2. Select the **target text**
3. Press **Alt+Up**

## Quick-add non-translatable (Ctrl+Alt+N)

For terms that should remain identical in source and target (brand names, product codes, abbreviations):

1. Select the text in the **source** field
2. Press **Ctrl+Alt+N**

This creates a term entry where source and target are the same. Non-translatable terms appear with a distinct yellow highlight in [TermLens (Workbench)](https://supervertaler.gitbook.io/supervertaler/glossaries/termlens).

## Add term entry (Ctrl+Alt+T)

For full control over a new term, press **Ctrl+Alt+T** (or right-click in the editor and choose **Add Term...**). This opens the **Add term entry** dialog, which lets you fill in all fields before saving:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Source** | The source-language term |
| **Target** | The target-language translation |
| **Source Abbreviation** | Optional abbreviated form (e.g. "GC" for "gaschromatografie"). Separate multiple variants with `\|`. |
| **Target Abbreviation** | Optional abbreviated form of the target term |
| **Source synonyms** | Alternative source-language forms for the same concept |
| **Target synonyms** | Alternative target-language translations |
| **Definition** | Optional definition or usage note |
| **Domain** | Subject area or client (e.g. "Legal", "ACME Corp") |
| **Notes** | Any additional notes for translators |
| **Non-translatable** | Check this to mark the term as non-translatable |

The term is added to the **project termbase** if one is configured, or the first write-enabled termbase otherwise.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Trados conflict:** Trados Studio assigns **Ctrl+Alt+T** to "Insert TM Symbol" by default. If pressing Ctrl+Alt+T does nothing, you need to remove Trados's binding first. Go to **File → Options → Keyboard Shortcuts**, search for "Insert TM Symbol", and delete or reassign its shortcut. Then Ctrl+Alt+T will work as expected in Supervertaler.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** Use the project termbase for client-specific terminology that should be prioritised over background termbases. Project termbase terms appear in pink in TermLens.
{% endhint %}

## Smart selection

You don't need to precisely select entire words when adding terms. All quick-add shortcuts (**Alt+Down**, **Alt+Up**, **Ctrl+Alt+N**, **Ctrl+Alt+T**) automatically expand your selection to the nearest word boundaries.

For example, to add **standalone version** = **zelfstandige versie** to your termbase, it's enough to select **alone ver** in the source and **andige ver** in the target. Supervertaler expands both selections to the full words automatically.

This means you can work fast and loose with your mouse or keyboard selections — no need for the precise click-and-drag that normally slows you down. Just grab roughly the right area and Supervertaler takes care of the rest.

### How it works

When you make a selection, Supervertaler scans the full segment text for every occurrence of your selected text and applies these rules, in order:

1. **Exact word match wins** — if the selection matches a complete word somewhere in the segment (i.e. it sits between spaces or punctuation), that word is used as-is. For example, if the segment contains both _hechtingsbevorderaars_ and _hechting_, selecting **hechting** returns **hechting** — the exact word — not the longer compound.

2. **Shortest word wins** — if the selection is embedded inside multiple words, the shortest enclosing word is preferred. For example, if the segment contains _hechtingsbevorderaars_ and _hechting_, selecting **echt** returns **hechting** (8 characters) rather than _hechtingsbevorderaars_ (21 characters), because the user most likely intended the simpler word.

3. **Single match expands** — if the selection appears inside only one word, it expands to that word's boundaries.

### Tips for reliable results

- **Select at least 3–4 characters** — very short selections (1–2 characters) may match common short words elsewhere in the segment (e.g., selecting **he** could match the word _the_)
- **Select the whole word when in doubt** — if a segment contains similar-looking words and you want a specific one, a complete-word selection is always matched correctly
- **Use Ctrl+Alt+T for tricky cases** — the Add Term Entry dialog lets you review and edit the expanded term before saving, so you can catch any unexpected expansion

{% hint style="info" %}
Press **F2** to manually expand your current selection to word boundaries without adding a term. This lets you preview exactly what Supervertaler would capture before pressing a quick-add shortcut.
{% endhint %}

## Merge prompt

When you add a term and the **source** or **target** already exists in the termbase (but with a different translation), Supervertaler shows a prompt asking what you want to do:

- **Add as Synonym** — merges the new translation into the existing entry as a synonym, keeping your termbase tidy
- **Add & Edit…** — adds the synonym and opens the Term Entry Editor so you can review the metadata before saving
- **Keep Both** — creates a separate entry alongside the existing one
- **Cancel** — aborts the operation

The merge prompt always displays terms in your **project's language direction**, regardless of how the termbase stores them internally. For example, in a Dutch → English project using an English → Dutch termbase, the dialog shows the Dutch source term first and the English target term second.

**Example:** Your termbase already has **adhesion → hechting**. You select **adhesion → aanhechting** and press Alt+Down. The merge prompt appears because the source term “adhesion” already exists. Clicking “Add as Synonym” adds _aanhechting_ as a target synonym of the existing entry, so both translations are grouped together.

{% hint style="info" %}
The merge prompt only appears when the source or target matches exactly (case-insensitive). It does **not** apply to non-translatable quick-add (**Ctrl+Alt+N**).
{% endhint %}

## Editing existing terms

To edit a term that already exists in your termbase:

1. Right-click the term in the **TermLens** panel
2. Select **Edit Term...**
3. The **Term Entry Editor** opens, where you can:
   - Modify the source or target text
   - Add or remove **synonyms** (multiple translations for one source term)
   - Update the definition
   - Toggle the non-translatable flag

Click **Save** when done.

## Abbreviations

Term entries can have optional **source and target abbreviation** fields. When a source abbreviation appears in a segment, TermLens highlights it and shows the target abbreviation underneath — just like a regular term match.

### Adding abbreviations

1. Open the **Term Entry Editor** (right-click a term → Edit Term)
2. Fill in the **Source Abbreviation** and **Target Abbreviation** fields
3. Click **Save**

### Multiple abbreviation variants

You can specify multiple variants of the same abbreviation by separating them with a **pipe character** (`|`):

```
GC|G.C.|gc|g.c.
```

Each variant is indexed and matched independently, so all common forms of the abbreviation are recognised in the source text. The **first variant** is used as the display text and for insertion.

### How abbreviation matching works

When both the full term and its abbreviation appear in the same segment (e.g., "gaschromatografie (GC)"), TermLens shows **both** as highlighted chips:

- The **full term** chip shows the full target translation (e.g., "gas chromatography") — displayed in the regular **blue** colour
- The **abbreviation** chip shows the target abbreviation (e.g., "GC") — displayed in **lavender** so it is instantly distinguishable from a full-term match

Clicking or Alt+digit-inserting an abbreviation chip inserts the **target abbreviation** (first variant), not the full target term.

{% hint style="info" %}
Abbreviations are also included in AI translation prompts, so the AI knows both the full term and its abbreviated form.
{% endhint %}

## Deleting terms

1. Right-click the term in the **TermLens** panel
2. Select **Delete Term**
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deletion is permanent. The term is removed from the termbase database file.
{% endhint %}

## Bulk Add Non-Translatable

For adding many non-translatable terms at once (e.g., a list of brand names or product codes):

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon in the TermLens panel)
2. Find the **Bulk Add Non-Translatable** option
3. Paste your terms, **one per line**
4. Click **Add** to save them all at once
