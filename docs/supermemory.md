# SuperMemory

SuperMemory is a self-organizing translation knowledge base that replaces traditional translation memories and term bases with a living, AI-maintained wiki. Instead of rigid fuzzy matching, SuperMemory gives the AI full contextual understanding of your clients, terminology decisions, domain conventions, and style preferences.

## How it works

SuperMemory is built on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and stores all knowledge as interlinked Markdown files — human-readable, portable, and future-proof.

The workflow has three phases:

### 1. Ingest

Drop raw material into the inbox: client briefs, style guides, glossaries, feedback notes, reference articles, or previous translations. SuperMemory accepts anything that helps you translate better.

### 2. Compile

The AI reads your raw material and writes structured knowledge base articles:

* **Client profiles** — language preferences, terminology decisions, style rules, project history
* **Terminology articles** — approved translations with rejected alternatives and the reasoning behind each choice
* **Domain knowledge** — conventions, common pitfalls, and reference material for specific fields (legal, medical, technical, marketing)
* **Style guides** — formatting rules, register, localisation conventions

Every article is interlinked with backlinks, so you can navigate from a client to their preferred terms to the domain those terms belong to.

### 3. Maintain

SuperMemory periodically scans itself for inconsistencies: conflicting terminology, broken links, stale content, missing cross-references. It heals itself — like a librarian who keeps the shelves organised.

## Why SuperMemory?

| Traditional TM/TB | SuperMemory |
|---|---|
| Fuzzy matching on surface text | Contextual understanding of _why_ terms were chosen |
| Static — requires manual updates | Self-healing — AI maintains and interlinks |
| Opaque — hard to audit decisions | Every decision traceable to a readable `.md` file |
| Locked to one tool | Portable Markdown — works with any editor |
| Segments in isolation | Connected knowledge graph |

## Folder structure

SuperMemory organises knowledge into six folders:

| Folder | Contents |
|---|---|
| `00_INBOX` | Raw material — drop zone for unprocessed content |
| `01_CLIENTS` | Client profiles and preferences |
| `02_TERMINOLOGY` | Term articles with translations, alternatives, and reasoning |
| `03_DOMAINS` | Domain-specific conventions and pitfalls |
| `04_STYLE` | Style guides and formatting rules |
| `05_INDICES` | Auto-generated indexes and maps of content |

## Getting started

SuperMemory ships as a vault skeleton in your [user data folder](data-folder.md):

```
C:\Users\{you}\Supervertaler\supermemory\
```

1. Open this folder as a vault in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Drop raw material (client briefs, glossaries, feedback) into `00_INBOX`
3. Run the compilation agent to process your inbox into structured articles
4. Watch your knowledge graph grow as connections form between clients, terms, and domains

## Quick Add (Ctrl+Alt+M)

While translating in Trados, you can instantly add a term or correction to your SuperMemory vault — and optionally inject it into your active translation prompt so the next Ctrl+T picks it up immediately.

### How to use

1. In the Trados editor, select the source text you want to capture (optional — the full source segment is used if nothing is selected)
2. Press **Ctrl+Alt+M** or right-click and choose **Add to SuperMemory**
3. Fill in the dialog:
   * **Term / pattern (what's wrong)** — the incorrect or ambiguous term (pre-filled from your selection)
   * **Correction** — the correct translation (pre-filled from target selection, if any). The label adapts to your target language (e.g. "Correct Dutch form")
   * **Notes** — optional context or explanation
   * **Also append to active translation prompt** — when ticked, a row is added to the TERMINOLOGY table in your [active prompt](#active-prompt) so the correction takes effect immediately
4. Click **Add**

### What happens

* A Markdown article is created in your vault's `02_TERMINOLOGY` folder with YAML frontmatter (source term, target term, domain, status, date)
* If the "append to prompt" option is ticked, a new row is inserted into the active prompt's terminology table — the prompt is read fresh from disk on every Ctrl+T, so the change is instant

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** Quick Add is the fastest way to build up your knowledge base while translating. Spotted a Dunglish pattern? Ctrl+Alt+M, type the correction, and carry on — your future translations automatically avoid that mistake.
{% endhint %}

## Active Prompt

Each Trados project can have an **active prompt** — the prompt that Quick Add appends terminology to. This is also the prompt that is auto-selected in the [Batch Translate](batch-translate.md) dropdown when you open the project.

### Setting the active prompt

1. Open **Settings → Prompts**
2. Right-click a translation prompt in the tree
3. Choose **Set as active prompt for this project**

The active prompt is shown with a pin icon and bold blue text in the Prompt Manager. In the Batch Translate dropdown, a checkmark appears next to the active prompt name.

To clear the active prompt, right-click it again and choose the same menu item (it toggles).

{% hint style="info" %}
The active prompt is saved [per project](settings/project-settings.md). Different Trados projects can have different active prompts.
{% endhint %}

## Integration with Supervertaler

When translating, the AI consults your SuperMemory knowledge base before producing a translation. It checks:

* The **client profile** for language preferences and style rules
* **Terminology articles** for approved translations (and knows which alternatives to avoid)
* **Domain knowledge** for conventions and common pitfalls
* **Style guides** for formatting and register

This means every translation is informed by your accumulated project knowledge — not just pattern matching, but real understanding.

## Installing Obsidian

SuperMemory stores all knowledge as Markdown files, which you can browse and edit with any text editor. For the best experience, we recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) — a free knowledge-base app that visualises the links between your articles as an interactive graph.

1. Download Obsidian from [https://obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download) (available for Windows, Mac, and Linux)
2. Install and open it — choose **Open folder as vault** and select your SuperMemory folder:
   ```
   C:\Users\{you}\Supervertaler\supermemory\
   ```
3. The free version of Obsidian includes everything you need — no subscription required. (The paid Sync and Publish add-ons are not needed for SuperMemory.)
